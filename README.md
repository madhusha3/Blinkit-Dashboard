🚀 Exciting Insights from Blinkit Sales Data Analysis 🚀

Hey everyone! I recently completed a project using Excel to analyze Blinkit's sales data, and I uncovered some fascinating insights that I couldn't wait to share. Here's what I found:

🍽️ 1. Fat Content Analysis:

Low-fat products are the clear winners with total sales of $776K, way ahead of regular-fat products at $425K. 
Interestingly, Tier 3 locations love their low-fat options, contributing $307K (40% of overall low-fat sales). It seems healthier choices are a big hit in less urbanized areas.
While low-fat products lead in volume, regular-fat products have higher average sales per item, showing they pack more value per sale.


🌍 2. Location-wise Sales:

Tier 3 locations are leading the charge with $472.13K in sales, followed by Tier 2 at $393.15K, and Tier 1 at $336.40K. This suggests huge potential for growth in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions.


🏗️ 3. Year-wise Outlet Performance:

Outlets opened in 2011 are lagging behind, while those from 2018 are smashing it with the highest sales. Newer outlets, especially post-2018, seem to be driving growth, likely due to better locations and efficiency.


🛒 4. Top-Selling Product Categories:

The top 3 categories are:

Fruits & Vegetables

Snacks Foods

Household Products

These categories are consistently popular across all tiers, though their rankings vary.


🏬 5. Outlet Size and Sales:

Larger outlets in Tier 3 locations are key, driving $98K in low-fat product sales, compared to $25K in Tier 2. This shows that bigger stores in less urban areas are crucial for these products.
Interestingly, large outlets are missing in Tier 1 locations, where medium and small outlets dominate.
In Tier 3, smaller outlets contribute less to overall sales, while medium outlets are steady across all tiers.

💡 Conclusion: This analysis highlights the importance of tailoring strategies to different regions, understanding product preferences, and optimizing outlet sizes. 
Tier 3 locations, in particular, show great potential, especially for low-fat products. 🌍
